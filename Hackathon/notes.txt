DATA 

Name:
- Full name of the car, including brand and model (e.g., "Toyota Corolla").
- Can be parsed to extract features like brand and model.

Price:
- Target variable, representing the selling price of the car.
- Typically in a specific currency (e.g., USD, INR).

Rating:
- A customer or expert rating of the car, possibly out of 5 or 10.
- Indicates popularity or quality.

City:
- The location where the car is being sold.
- Prices may vary by region due to demand and supply.

Kilometers:
- Total distance the car has been driven (mileage).
- Higher mileage generally reduces resale value.

Year_of_Purchase:
- The year the car was originally purchased.
- Used to calculate the car’s age.

Owner:
- The number of previous owners of the car (e.g., 1st owner, 2nd owner).
- Fewer owners typically increase resale value.

Fuel_Type:
- Type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid).
- Impacts running costs and desirability.

Transmission:
- Type of transmission (e.g., Manual or Automatic).
- Automatic cars may have higher resale value in some markets.

RTO:
- Regional registration authority of the car.
- May provide regional pricing trends but overlaps with `City`.

Insurance:
- Indicates whether the car has valid insurance.
- Valid insurance may slightly increase resale value.

Insurance_Type:
- Type of insurance coverage (e.g., Comprehensive or Third-party).
- Comprehensive insurance is generally more valuable.

step 1 Data Understanding


For a used car price prediction model, you'll want to include features that are most relevant to determining a car's value. Here's an analysis of the columns and their usefulness:

### Relevant Features for Price Prediction:
1. **Name**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Limited direct use. However, you can extract features like the **brand** and **model**, which are useful.
   - **Action**: Parse the name to extract meaningful categories such as the manufacturer (e.g., "Toyota", "Honda") and the model.

2. **Price**:  
   - **Usefulness**: This is your target variable (dependent variable), not a predictor.

3. **Rating**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Could indicate customer satisfaction or popularity, which might influence price.  
   - **Action**: Retain if available.

4. **City**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Prices can vary significantly between locations due to demand and supply.
   - **Action**: Encode as a categorical variable or use regional average price trends.

5. **Kilometers**:  
   - **Usefulness**: High mileage typically decreases a car's value.
   - **Action**: Retain as a numerical feature.

6. **Year_of_Purchase**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Age of the car is crucial for depreciation analysis.
   - **Action**: Convert to **Car_Age** using the current year (e.g., `Car_Age = Current_Year - Year_of_Purchase`).

7. **Owner**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Cars with multiple previous owners often have lower resale value.
   - **Action**: Encode as a categorical or numerical variable (e.g., 1 for first owner, 2 for second owner).

8. **Fuel_Type**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Diesel, petrol, electric, and hybrid cars can have different market values.
   - **Action**: Encode as categorical data.

9. **Transmission**:  
   - **Usefulness**: Automatic cars may have higher prices in some markets compared to manual ones.
   - **Action**: Encode as categorical data.

10. **RTO (Regional Transport Office)**:  
    - **Usefulness**: Limited unless RTO can indicate regional price differences (like **City**).
    - **Action**: Likely redundant if **City** is already included.

11. **Insurance**:  
    - **Usefulness**: If it's **valid** insurance, it can slightly increase the price.  
    - **Action**: Create a binary feature (e.g., 1 for valid insurance, 0 for expired).

12. **Insurance_Type**:  
    - **Usefulness**: Comprehensive insurance might increase a car's value compared to third-party insurance.
    - **Action**: Encode as categorical data.


### Final Selected Features:
1. **Brand/Model** (from `Name`)
2. **Rating**
3. **City**
4. **Kilometers**
5. **Car_Age** (derived from `Year_of_Purchase`)
6. **Owner**
7. **Fuel_Type**
8. **Transmission**
9. **Insurance** (valid or not)
10. **Insurance_Type**

### Features Likely Excluded:
- `RTO` (if redundant with `City`).

These features provide a strong foundation for predicting used car prices. Additional preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical data, scaling numerical data, and handling missing values) will further improve our model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the sample data you provided, here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to clean and convert the columns correctly:

### 1. **Price**:
The **Price** column has the currency symbol (₹) and commas that need to be removed. After that, you can convert it to a `float` type.

### 2. **Rating**:
The **Rating** column has the format "X out of Y", and you'll want to extract the numerical rating (before "out of 5") and convert it to a `float`.

### 3. **Kilometers**:
The **Kilometers** column contains both numbers and the "km" string, so you’ll need to remove the "km" and commas to convert it to a numerical type (likely `float`).

### 4. **Year_of_Purchase**:
The **Year_of_Purchase** column has mixed data, like "May 2010" or "July 2013". You’ll likely want to extract just the year and convert it to an `int`.

Here's a Python code example to clean the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data (replace this with your actual DataFrame)
data = {
    'Price': ['₹ 174,699', '₹ 333,999', '₹ 353,199', '₹ 237,899', '₹ 300,699'],
    'Rating': ['4out of 5', '4.2out of 5', '4.3out of 5', '4.4out of 5', '4.4out of 5'],
    'Kilometers': ['34,854 km', '39,541 km', '23,233 km', '27,748 km', '12,238 km'],
    'Year_of_Purchase': ['May 2010', 'July 2013', 'March 2014', 'November 2013', 'August 2017'],
    'Owner': ['First Owner', 'Second Owner', 'Second Owner', 'First Owner', 'Second Owner'],
    'Fuel_Type': ['Petrol', 'Petrol', 'Petrol', 'Petrol', 'Petrol'],
    'Transmission': ['MANUAL', 'MANUAL', 'MANUAL', 'MANUAL', 'MANUAL'],
    'RTO': ['AP09', 'AP28', 'AP28', 'AP13', 'TS10'],
    'Insurance': [None, '6/8/2021', '28/4/2021', '1/1/2022', None],
    'Insurance_Type': ['Insurance Expired', 'Comp', 'Comp', 'Comp', 'Expired']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# 1. Clean and convert the 'Price' column
df['Price'] = df['Price'].replace({'₹': '', ',': ''}, regex=True).astype(float)

# 2. Clean and convert the 'Rating' column (extract the numerical part)
df['Rating'] = df['Rating'].str.split('out').str[0].astype(float)

# 3. Clean and convert the 'Kilometers' column
df['Kilometers'] = df['Kilometers'].replace({' km': '', ',': ''}, regex=True).astype(float)

# 4. Extract the year from 'Year_of_Purchase' and convert to integer
df['Year_of_Purchase'] = df['Year_of_Purchase'].str.extract(r'(\d{4})').astype(int)

# Display the cleaned DataFrame
print(df)
```

### Explanation:
- **Price**: I use `replace()` to remove the currency symbol (`₹`) and commas, then convert it to `float`.
- **Rating**: I split the string at the word "out" and keep the part before it, converting it to a `float`.
- **Kilometers**: I use `replace()` to remove "km" and commas, then convert the remaining string to a `float`.
- **Year_of_Purchase**: I use a regular expression (`\d{4}`) to extract the year (the 4-digit number) and convert it to `int`.

### Output:
After running this code, the DataFrame will have cleaned and correctly typed columns.

For example, the cleaned `df` would look something like this:

| Price    | Rating | Kilometers | Year_of_Purchase | Owner         | Fuel_Type | Transmission | RTO  | Insurance  | Insurance_Type     |
|----------|--------|------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------|------------|--------------------|
| 174699.0 | 4.0    | 34854.0    | 2010             | First Owner   | Petrol    | MANUAL      | AP09 | NaN        | Insurance Expired  |
| 333999.0 | 4.2    | 39541.0    | 2013             | Second Owner  | Petrol    | MANUAL      | AP28 | 6/8/2021   | Comp               |
| 353199.0 | 4.3    | 23233.0    | 2014             | Second Owner  | Petrol    | MANUAL      | AP28 | 28/4/2021  | Comp               |
| 237899.0 | 4.4    | 27748.0    | 2013             | First Owner   | Petrol    | MANUAL      | AP13 | 1/1/2022   | Comp               |
| 300699.0 | 4.4    | 12238.0    | 2017             | Second Owner  | Petrol    | MANUAL      | TS10 | NaN        | Expired            |

This should make the columns suitable for further analysis or modeling.
